# The Great Canadian Masterpiece
For our hackathon project, we decided to make a text-based survival/adventure game that focuses on Canadian history and geography. 
As the mysterious unknown eigth member of the [Group of Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven_(artists)), you decide to embark on an adventure to paint all of Canada's famous landmarks.
However, Canada can be a cold and harsh place. As a sheltered artist, you're not the brightest when it comes to camping and exploring the wilderness.

Explore beautiful landmarks in this 8-bit game. Be sure to stay away from wild animals, protect yourself from the cold, and make sure you have enough supplies for the night.
The last thing you want to do is to freeze or starve before you can finish painting all of Canada!
