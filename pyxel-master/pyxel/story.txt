"""
It is quite a sunny day. The sun is beaming down and you are in the bustling town of Banff, ready to explore the
great forests of Alberta. With its various coniferous trees and wandering animals, you are ecstatic to experience what land has to offer. A dear friend of yours has
informed you of a spectacular lake known as Lake Louise. A wondrous oasis somewhere in the midst of Alberta's vast greenery. You are inspired to paint its sparkling waters
against the backdrop of Banff Forest.
